Hi!

I am a second year master student at the University of University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am currently a research assistant in the [DAIR Lab](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/), advised by Professor Michael Posa, where I study robotics and control theory. My main focuse is on robust, dexterous manipulation and  principled robot control thoery.

Previously, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from both Zhejiang University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At Zhejiang University, I conducted research on origami-based millimeter-scale magnetic robots under the supervision of Professor Peng Zhao. At UIUC, I worked with Professor Lili Cai on developing radiative cooling materials.

If you find my project interest and want to cooperate with me, please email me at haorany8 [at]seas[dot]upenn[dot]edu
